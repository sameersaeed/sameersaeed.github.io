                <p class="project-p">Goal<p>
                The goal of this project was to create a system in which users could 
                organize order data, whether it be for personal or business use. 
                <br><br>

                <p class="project-p">Target userbase</p>
                The target user for this system is someone who has transactions that they wish to keep track of.
                The site was designed with this in mind, so there are various options for different types of orders to be stored.
                <br><br>

                <p class="project-p">How it works</p>
                <ul class="project-bullets">
                    <li>
                        Users are directed to a home screen through which they can choose to either log in or create a new account.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In order to create a new account, users must select a username and password, as well as verify their
                        password to ensure that no mistakes are made. New user data then gets saved to the system's database.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To login, users simply input their username and password which are then verified by the database, 
                        allowing the user to login.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once logged in, users are taken to their personal home page, where they can create new orders as well 
                        as view and modify/delete previously created orders.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Below is a pictoral description of how the user can interact with the site.

                <p class="project-p">Languages used</p>
                This site uses <b>HTML/CSS</b>, <b>Bootstrap</b> and <b>Javascript</b> for its front-end design.
                <br><b>HTML/CSS</b> is used in conjunction with <b>Bootstrap</b> in order to give the site a clean and modern look.<br>
                <br>Javascript is used in order to allow the user to make SQL MODIFY and DELETE queries through the front-end using the
                    Tabledit JS library.
                <br>This allows users to modify/delete data within their transactions table.<br> 
                <br><br>
                
                <br>A <b>MySQL</b> database was also used to store data and allow users to access and modify their data through queries. SQL queries
                    are made in the back-end using <b>PHP</b>.<br>
                <br>The site was hosted as an <b>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</b> instance using <b>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</b>. 
                    <b>LAMP</b>, packaged by <b>Bitnami for AWS Cloud</b>, was
                    used to provide a quick-to-launch development environment. 
                <br>The database capacity is up to 10GiB via an <b>Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS)</b> volume which hosts the data, allowing for 1000s of data instances
                    to be stored and quickly accessed on the system. 
                <br><br>

                <b>How the database works</b>
                <ul class="project-bullets">
                    <li> 
                        To login and display orders, <b>SELECT</b> queries are made in the database. <b>JOIN</b> is used to group all of a user's 
                        orders together at once.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        To register a user and modify orders, <b>INSERT</b> queries are made in the database.                            
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        To delete orders, <b>DELETE</b> queries are made in the database.                            
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br><br><br>

                <ul class="project-bullets">
                    <li>Add section to calculate profits / debt for users</li>
                    <li>Add more user options (home page customizability, profile pictures), increase user security (password reset, 2FA),
                        allow interaction between users (followers, groups, messaging), etc.</li>
                    <li>Improve front-end design (site name, logo, better design)</li>
